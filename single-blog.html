              Exceptionally positioned and naturally spectacular, Barangaroo Reserve marks the transformation of Sydney’s industrial harbour
              foreshore into a sprawling six-hectare parkland. With Sydney Harbour as the ultimate backdrop, the Reserve
              is an original and inspiring destination for a myriad of indoor and outdoor events.
